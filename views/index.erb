<h1>Printer Paint</h1>

<p>(A demo <a href="http://printer.gofreerange.com">Printer</a> application)</p>

<p>This application can send drawings to printers, where they will be printed out. <a href="http://printer.gofreerange.com/">Find out more about printers</a>. It's really just an example of how you can build a simple content provider for diminutive internet printers.</p>

<p><b>If you just want to poke around you can <a href="/send/freerange">send Free Range a sketch</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-paint">take a look at the source</a></b>.</p>
  
<p>If you have a printer, and want to use this instance of Printer Paint to receive pictures you can <a href="/register">register here</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't have a printer, <b>why not <a href="http://printer.gofreerange.com/getting-a-printer">find out how to get or make a printer</a> for yourself?</b></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The paint app is very similar to the <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer-mail">mail app</a>. Printers are registered by storing their print URL along side a nickname, which forms the URL in this app (e.g. <a href="/send/freerange">/send/freerange</a>).</p>

<p>When a drawing is "sent", the contents of the HTML5 canvas are serialised into a form field and stored in the database, associated with the printer record.</p>

<p>The application then sends a request to the given print URL with the URL for that drawing (e.g. <a href="/pictures/6">/pictures/6</a>). The <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer">printer backend server</a> then takes care of rasterising the image, and making it available to the right printer.</p>
